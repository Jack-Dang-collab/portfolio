          In terms of front-end development, I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux, and TailwindCSS.

          In addition to front-end development, I am also interested in blockchain technology. I have experience with Ethereum, Solidity, and Thirdweb framework, and I have built several decentralized applications (DApps) that leverage smart contracts to provide secure and transparent functionality. I believe that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize many industries, and I am excited to be a part of this emerging field.
