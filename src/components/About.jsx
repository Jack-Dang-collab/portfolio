          Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Thanh, and I am a self-taught blockchain developer with a passion for building innovative decentralized applications. My journey into blockchain began out of a curiosity for how this emerging technology could transform traditional systems and industries.

          One of my most exciting projects involved building a crowdfunding platform on the blockchain. This platform allowed users to contribute to various campaigns in a secure and transparent manner, leveraging the power of smart contracts to ensure that funds were distributed fairly and as per the campaign's conditions.

          Another project I worked on was a horoscope application that delivered personalized astrological readings to users. I utilized the RapidAPI to fetch relevant astrological data and displayed it in a user-friendly interface that made the application accessible to everyone.

          My most recent project is a web3 marketplace built using Solidity. This platform enables sellers and buyers to sell and buy goods without a third party to monitor, making transactions more secure, transparent, and efficient. I am constantly seeking new ways to explore the potential of blockchain technology and how it can benefit society.

          If you are looking for a self-motivated and innovative blockchain developer who can bring your ideas to life, then I would love to hear from you.
