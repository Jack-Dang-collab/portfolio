        As a self-taught developer with a passion for blockchain technology, I am excited to bring my skills and expertise to the world of decentralized applications.

        With two pet projects under my belt, I have gained valuable experience in developing blockchain-based applications. One of my projects involved building a crowdfunding platform using blockchain technology, which enabled users to contribute to various campaigns in a secure and transparent manner. Another project involved creating a horoscope application that leveraged the RapidAPI to deliver personalized astrological readings to users.

        In addition to my experience with blockchain technology and external APIs, I also have a solid foundation in Node.js, which I use to develop server-side applications and APIs. This expertise allows me to create robust and scalable blockchain applications that can handle complex business logic and data management.

        As a junior blockchain developer, I am eager to continue expanding my skills and knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. I am committed to building secure and reliable blockchain applications that can help drive the adoption of decentralized technologies and bring more transparency and trust to various industries.

        Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and contribute to innovative blockchain projects.
